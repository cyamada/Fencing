#Arduino powered scoring machine

This is the current working code for foil and epee in compliance with USFA regulations. The code is not complete 
however, you should be able to get a good idea of how it works. I'll be sure to update this with the final code
and schematics once they are finished. 

If you have any questions or are interested in backing this project please send me an email at <ckyamada@gmail.com></code>
